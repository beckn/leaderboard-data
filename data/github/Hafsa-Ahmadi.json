      "text": "@ravi-prakash-v, I'm interested in implementing this OpenAPI validation workflow. I would use GitHub Actions with a Node.js validation script to check the transaction.yaml, meta.yaml, and registry.yaml against OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.  I have experience with CI/CD and OpenAPI validation. Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?"

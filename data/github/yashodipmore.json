      "text": "Hi @Ravi Prakash,\n\nI came across the issue titled “Need a User Interface for Managing GTFS files” under the Beckn project and I’m really interested in contributing to it.\n\nI’ve understood the problem and goals — designing a CMS-style UI that supports reading, updating, deleting, and validating GTFS data interactively. With experience in React.js and Node.js, I’m confident I can handle both frontend and backend aspects of this task.\n\nCould you please assign this issue to me? I’m excited to contribute meaningfully to the Beckn ecosystem."

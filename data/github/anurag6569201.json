Earlier it was named Tinker AI (https://github.com/coderxtushar/Tinker-AI), but due to some merge conflicts and errors in the codebase, which resulted in the loss of some of my local repo code as well, I had to take this step.\n> \n> Like these ---> ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac23575-d2b8-4061-a965-33f29770e0c0)\n> \n> Hope i might be able to convince you, and if not then here is my Discord Id(https://discordapp.com/users/1014353403738079242) I’d be happy to walk you through the architecture sometime.\n\n\nHey bro,  \nI just went through your entire repos—[**Tinker-AI**](https://github.com/coderxtushar/Tinker-AI) and [**Snap-UI**](https://snap-ui-lovat.vercel.app/)—and I found something **very suspicious**.\n\n---\n\n###  What I Observed:\n\n#### 1. **Suspicious Commit History**\n- Only **1–2 commits** in both repos.\n- A real developer commits **gradually** with progress. \n- All your commits are **just additions**, no code deletions/modifications.  \n  Clearly pointing to **copy-paste behavior**.\n<img width=\"1393\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf3a39c3-1e59-4c74-bf69-8d7f85274d0e\" />\n\n#### 2. **Timeline Doesn’t Match**\n- Your repo dates:\n  - **Tinker-AI** → Feb 15, 2025\n  - **Snap-UI** → April 16, 2025\n- But the **original project** was created **way before that**:\n  - **Original Website**: https://thunder-bolt-new.vercel.app/\n  - **Original GitHub Repo**: [ThunderBolt.New](https://github.com/chiragsingh1/ThunderBolt.New)\n\n\n#### 3. **Exact Code Match**\n- Your code is **nearly identical** to [chiragsingh1’s repo](https://github.com/chiragsingh1/ThunderBolt.New).\n- Folder structure, file names, and component logic are the **same**.\n- You just **renamed the repo**, added some metadata, and pushed.\n\n#### 4. **Trying to Mislead**\n- You are **pretending** to be the creator to **fool mentors** and the community.\n- This is straight-up **unethical** and disrespectful to the real developer’s effort.\n\n---\n\n### Final Note:\nIf you want to be a real dev, either:\n- **Build from scratch**, or  \n- **Give credit** to the original creator.\n\n**Open-source is for learning and collaboration—not for stealing and misleading.**\n\n"

      "text": "Hi @viraj89 ,\n\nI came across the project proposal for the no-code, AI-enabled Beckn Catalog Builder and I'm very interested in contributing. The vision to simplify Beckn catalog creation using generative AI and NLP aligns well with my interests and experience.\n\n\nBased on the project requirements, I believe my skills could be a good fit. I have experience with:\n\n- **Web Technologies:** Including React.js for frontend development and Django/Node.js for backend integration.   \n\n- **AI/ML & Generative AI:** I've worked with Python, LangChain, and integrated Generative AI APIs like Gemini in past projects, including building platforms involving AI-driven features and data processing.   \n\n- **Cloud & Tools:** Familiar with tools like Docker, Git/GitHub Actions, and cloud platforms such as Azure.   \n\n- **Open Source:** I also have prior experience contributing to open-source projects.   \n\n\nProjects like Visora (an AI-Powered Education Marketplace ) and Sanitas (a Disease Surveillance Platform ) involved building AI-integrated web applications, which seems relevant to the goals of this Catalog Builder.   \n\nI'm eager to learn more about how I can contribute, whether it's related to the frontend UI, backend development, AI integration, or testing. Please let me know the best way to get involved.\n\nThanks,\n\nAnurag Singh\nLink to your GitHub profile: https://github.com/anurag6569201\nLink to your portfolio/website: https://anurag.icu"

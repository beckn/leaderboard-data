This project excites me, especially the use of Beckn and AI agents to streamline collaboration.\n\nIâ€™d love to contribute and learn more about how AI is being implemented here. It would be great if you could share some starting points or key skills I should focus on to get involved effectively. Looking forward to contributing!"

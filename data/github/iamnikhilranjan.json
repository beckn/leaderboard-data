      "text": "Hi @viraj89 ðŸ‘‹\n\nI'm **Nikhil Ranjan**, a 2nd year studend and a developer passionate about building AI-powered tools and open digital ecosystems like Beckn.\n\nIâ€™m very excited about this project, as it closely matches my experience with:\n- Integrating **LLMs** like OpenAI for real-time content generation\n- Building **modular, scalable React.js UIs** with state machine workflows\n- Designing **prompt engineering pipelines** for natural language-driven interfaces\n- Seamless **backend integrations** with external protocols\n\nIâ€™m currently diving deeper into **advanced prompt engineering** and **generative AI**, and Iâ€™m confident these skills will directly support building intuitive, no-code Beckn apps.\n\nI'm eager to contribute to areas like:\n- **AI-driven UI generation workflows**\n- **Visual drag-and-drop state machine builder**\n- **Beckn Protocol integration**\n\nI believe my background, combined with a **product-first mindset**, would allow me to contribute meaningfully and help deliver a robust, user-friendly tool.\n\nWould love to connect on any communication channel and start contributing! \n\nLooking forward to collaborating,  \n**Nikhil Ranjan**\n"

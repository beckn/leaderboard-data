      "text": "Hi @beckn , @ravi-prakash-v ðŸ‘‹,\n\nIâ€™m really excited about the opportunity to contribute to this foundational algorithm!\n\nWith a strong background in backend development, data processing, and cloud-native architectures, Iâ€™m confident I can add value to this issue. In my previous work, Iâ€™ve built systems that involve real-time data handling and predictive analyticsâ€”such as a Production Planning Automation System at AkzoNobel, where I worked on dynamic scheduling algorithms powered by live SAP data.\n\nI also led the development of Nectar, an AI-powered mobile app, and MatchMentor, a microservices-based platform with real-time communication featuresâ€”both of which involved complex logic flows and optimization tasks. Iâ€™m well-versed with Python, Node.js, and containerized environments (Docker/Kubernetes), and I enjoy building clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.\n\nIâ€™d love to dive into this challenge and collaborate with the teamâ€”please consider assigning me this issue!\n\nThanks!\nAtharva Karval\n[GitHub](https://github.com/ironman2024) | [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/atharva-karval)"

      "text": "Hi @beckn ðŸ‘‹,\n\nIâ€™ve read through issue #1 and would love to work on converting a sample GTFS dataset into a Beckn-compliant format.\n\nWith hands-on experience in data pipelines, API integrations, and working with transport-related datasets during academic and personal projects, Iâ€™m confident I can handle the schema mapping and transformation accurately. Iâ€™m also happy to document the process to help others follow along.\n\nPlease let me know if I can be assigned this task â€” looking forward to contributing to the Beckn ecosystem!\n\nThanks,\nAtharva Karval\n[GitHub](https://github.com/ironman2024) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharva-karval/)"

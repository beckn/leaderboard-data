      "text": "Hi @viraj89,\n\nI'd love to take this up! Having built Snap UI (https://snap-ui-lovat.vercel.app/) —a no-code, AI-powered UI generator that turns natural language into structured React components—I’m confident in handling prompt interpretation, schema structuring, and real-time UI feedback.\n\nThis Beckn Catalog Builder aligns perfectly with my experience in AI-driven interface generation, and I’d love to bring that expertise to this repo. Would be great if you could assign me this one .\n\nThanks, \nTushar Gautam"

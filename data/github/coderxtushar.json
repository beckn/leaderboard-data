Earlier it was named Tinker AI (https://github.com/coderxtushar/Tinker-AI), but due to some merge conflicts and errors in the codebase, which resulted in the loss of some of my local repo code as well, I had to take this step.\n\nLike these --->\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac23575-d2b8-4061-a965-33f29770e0c0)\n\nHope i might be able to convince you, and if not then here is my Discord Id(https://discordapp.com/users/1014353403738079242) I’d be happy to walk you through the architecture sometime.\n\n\n\n \n"

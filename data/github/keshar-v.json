      "text": "Hey @viraj89 ,\n\nI’ve gone through the scope and architecture — this is the kind of system I want to help shape.\n\nI've worked with React, Tailwind, and API-driven apps. My approach is product-focused: build clean, modular code that scales and actually improves UX for devs. And I’m here to deliver.\n\nIf you're building something that represents the future of open digital commerce, I'd like to be hands-on.\nBest,\nKeshar Verma."

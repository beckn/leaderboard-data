      "text": "Subject: Interest in Contributing to No-Code Al-Enabled Catalog Generator for Beckn-Compliant Commerce\n\nHi @viraj89 \n\nI’m Ghanshyam, a final-year B.Tech CSE student from Stani Memorial College of Engineering and Technology. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to this project. The real-world impact it could have—especially in underserved communities—aligns closely with my passion for building meaningful applications.\n\nI’ve explored the problem space and have begun brainstorming solutions, including leveraging MERN stack for real-time progress tracking or integrating interactive UI/UX to boost engagement. With experience in full-stack development (MERN), I’ve built projects like:\n\nWandarlust: An Airbnb-inspired platform with user auth, dynamic search, and booking systems.\n\nE-commerce App: A scalable product with payment integration and admin dashboards.\n\nSimon Says Game: A lightweight interactive game showcasing frontend logic.\n\nI’m confident I can contribute to making this platform robust and user-centric. Is there a Slack/Discord space for collaborators? I’d love to join discussions and refine my approach.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nGhanshyam"

      "text": "Hi @viraj89 ,\nThis project idea really resonates with me, and I'm excited about the potential impact it can create by making Beckn UIs more accessible through AI and no-code tools. I'd love to contribute, especially in areas like frontend development, state machine workflows, and AI-driven UI generation.\n\nCould you please share if thereâ€™s a Discord or Slack channel ?\n\nLooking forward to connecting and contributing! \n\nBest,\nVaishnavi"

      "text": "\n> Enquiring about communication channels\n\nhey sir @viraj89  , i would like to contribute in this project as i have already build some of GEN AI applications using LLM's such as chatgpt  , Gemini models and some of local LLM's also using Ollama. I am really excited about this project contribution as i have required skills and experience regarding that. \n\n### Iâ€™d love to help with:\n\n- Frontend architecture for the drag-and-drop state machine builder.\n- AI-powered UI generation logic.\n- Beckn Protocol API integrations.\n- AI-driven natural language input processing.\n\nI would like to apply for this project for C4GT'25 , can you provide the _discord/slack_ communication channels where we can clarify our doubts along the way of drafting proposal. \n\nLooking forward to collaborating!\n"

      "text": "I'm excited about this initiative, as I've already built an AI-powered development assistant that closely matches many of your requirements.\n\nThat app currently offers:\n\n- Integration with 18 LLM providers and real-time streaming capabilities\n- An enterprise-grade code generation pipeline with context-aware prompting\n- A WebContainer-based execution environment for real-time code testing\n- A high-performance chat interface for natural language interactions\n\n\nWith some focused enhancements, it can be adapted to:\n\n- Integrate seamlessly with Beckn Protocol endpoints\n- Implement visual state machine workflow editing\n- Provide component palettes tailored for Beckn UI elements \n\nFurther enhance the no-code experience for non-technical users\nI believe leveraging my app as a foundation will accelerate development and ensure a robust, scalable solution. I’d love to contribute and collaborate on this project—happy to discuss how we can tailor the existing codebase to meet Beckn’s specific needs!\n\n@viraj89 is there any communication channel where we can discuss this further?"
